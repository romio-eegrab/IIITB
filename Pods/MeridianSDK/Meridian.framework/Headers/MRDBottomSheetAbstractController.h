/**
 Used as an abstract class that automatically interfaces with MRDBottomSheetViewController
 as the parent controller for closing, scrolling and display. Inherit from this abstraction
 for a custom detailed view inside the MRDBottomSheetViewController.
 
 Note: This abstract class is autolayout enabled.
 
 Note: When migrating to Swift 3.2 / 4, it would be worth considering to remove 
 the abstract class and move to protocol extensions with default implementations.

/// notable differences.  If no minimumHeight is defined and we're not of a fixed size:
/// - The maximum amount we will show before `isExapandable` will be `YES`
///   is 1/3 of the total screen size. If subviews are added that will cause
///   our height to be beyond that **OR** if a `UIScrollView` (or subclass
///   such as `UITableView`/`UICollectionView`) is added as a subview
///   we will allow expanding to the maximum sheet size regardless of contents
/// - Minimum height will be automatically calulcated to fit the content
///   or 1/3 of the screen. Whichever is less (padding is automatically added)
/// - If one of the previous configurations causes us to automatically set
///   `isExapandable` to `YES`, toggling it to `NO` will have no effect.
