/// actions associated with them.
typedef void(^MRDVerticalSegmentedAction)(void);


/**
 A vertical segmented control that can be created automatically by supplying 
 images or strings to display. This control will lay them out in the order they 
 are received top to bottom. It has the appearance of drop shadow plus blur as 
 well as adding dividers in between. In addition a theme color can be provided
 which will color the normal images or strings with this color.
 
 There are two ways to register for this control. One way is to use 
 addTarget:action:forControlEvents: on UIControlEventValueChanged. Then check 
 the selectedSegmentIndex property for the selected segment. The second way is 
 to supply an array of dictionaries containing two keys: `image` and `action`. 
 `image` will contain the name of the image to display, and `action` will be of 
 type MRDVerticalSegmentedAction. When the segment is tapped, it will execute the 
 action. It is important to note that with addTarget:action:forControlEvents:, 
 it will not execute twice in a row if a segment is tapped twice in a row. It 
 will only execute once because the value only changed once. Though using 
 actions it will execute no matter how many times in a row the same segment is 
 tapped.
